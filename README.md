# Kroton-shaper

Shaper for [Kroton](https://github.com/sdangelo/kroton).

I am too lazy to explain hows and whys.

## TODO

* support for all sorts of stuff;
* extra border option;
* support multiple fonts and fallbacks;
* script + font variations? use x/advance rather than xMin/xMax?
* are stacked ascenders/descenders handled correctly (e.g., root, stack)?
* special handling of integral symbol?
* browserification;
* API review;
* documentation;
* tests.
